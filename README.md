# HealthCareApp
It’s an Android application which is mainly concerned with maintaining people’s health and give them an easy environment where they can monitor their health records, doctors can manage their schedules, parents can manage their child’s _vaccination records_ and set reminders so that in this busy life they do not forget about it and their children are healthy when they grow up. 
It also provides a _Pill Reminder_ feature in which a user can set reminders for their pill schedule so that the app could remind them to take the pill in time.

The main catch of this application are the last two modules: 

**Emergency Chat**:

Mortality and morbidity in trauma remain a major problem in developing countries. Organized emergency response systems for transfer of trauma patients to hospitals are absent and the consequent delays could cause significant complications. According to a study: _Out of 978 patients, only 303 (30.9%) patients reach the emergency room (ER) within an hour_.
Keeping this in mind, this app connects the person sitting inside the ambulance having some medical knowledge to a doctor while there is a traffic jam. This person could speak the problems to the doctor and the doctor could send him/her some pictures diagrams or videos to help him understand what to do in this emergency. This could save a lot of lives and the death figures could be reduced which happen during the transfer of the patient from his/her place to the hospi-tal.

**Ambulance Locator** : 

With this module one can locate and book nearby ambulance. He can see real time location of ambulance and can book nearest ambulance. Thus, this can help to save a lot of time to take patient to hospital. Any hospital can register itself on app and provide ambulance service.
